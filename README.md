# Google Leads Frontend

Google leads is a project that uses the Google Maps Places API. The frontend is built with React, Context API for state management, and Material UI. As of 2/21/2021, I have not worked on this project. There is a bug in the home screen where it doesn't save the correct info to the users "my places". The user can manually create their own data though. So that works.

Checkout branch "current" for the current build with all the bugs :)

Also, the "welcome page" only has the title "welcome page". When I last worked on this, I was in the process of fixing the issue with the creation of a "place" for the user. So I didn't get to making this page yet.

## Installation

After you have cloned this repo, in your cli run: 

```bash
npm i && npm start
```

This will open up the frontend!

## Usage

I made this app because I wanted an easier and more streamlined way of looking up businesses on google. I freelance and checking if a business even has a website or a modern website, is crucial to my work! 

The way this works is by the user being taken to the home page where you type in a desired location and then hitting submit will give you a list of businesses within a mile radius of the desired location.
