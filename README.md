# Google Leads Frontend

Google leads is a project that uses the Google Maps Places API. The frontend is built with React, Context API for state management, and Material UI. As of 2/21/2021, I have not worked on this project because I am currently focusing on other things at the moment, but I am planning on working on the fullstack features sometime this week!

## Installation

After you have cloned this repo, in your cli run: 

```bash
npm i && npm start
```

This will open up the frontend!

## Usage

I made this app because I wanted an easier and more streamlined way of looking up businesses on google. I freelance and checking if a business even has a website or a modern website, is crucial to my work! 

The way this works is by the user being taken to the home page where you type in a desired location and then hitting submit will give you a list of businesses within a mile radius of the desired location.
